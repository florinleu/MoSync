    This app works only on Android and iOS and exemplifies the usage of modal
dialog widgets.
    When the app is launched you will see some labels indicating that your
personal details are not filled yet. By clicking the "Fill Form" button a dialog
will be shown, in which you have to fill you personal info: gender and
age. After you pick a gender and drag on the slider bar for age you can click
"Ready". After "Ready" is clicked the dialog gets dismissed and in the main
screen of the app you will see what you have selected.
App can exit using the back button on Android.
